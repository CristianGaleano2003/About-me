# About-me
I'm Cristian Galeano, a data analyst with a passion for transforming raw information into strategic insight. I specialize in technologies like SQL, Python, VBA, DAX, and M Language, and Iâ€™m comfortable navigating across multiple programming environments to create optimized, scalable solutions.

My foundation in finance and economics empowers me to understand the broader business context, whether I'm calculating net salary and legal compensation or analyzing economic indicators. I also bring experience in Power BI, Tableau, and process automation through tools like Git and PowerShell.

I thrive in environments where I can contribute to meaningful projects and exchange ideas with talented professionals. My goal is to support cross-functional initiatives, add analytical value, and continuously learn from others to sharpen my perspective and broaden my impact.
